# Bongo

Bongo is a proof of concept java driver for mongo.  I felt the mongo driver was wasting a lot of time and resources in client land so I tried to see if I could understand why.  Turned out expanding those ideas of why to a functional driver was way more involved than I initially thought.  Working on it a bit every few weeks is not enough to get near a feature complete driver.

Currently basic non transactional operations on a collections work, sdam functions enough to connect to a cluster and understand failure.
